# Ultrawide preset

Optimized for a 21:9 monitor exposed as `DP-2` with an auxiliary display on `HDMI-A-1` for cinematic or focus workspaces.

## Application targets
- Primary focus app (any class) centered on workspace `10`
- Reference browsers with classes `Firefox` or `qutebrowser`
- Messaging apps with classes `Slack` or `TelegramDesktop`

## Workspace layout assumptions
- Workspace `10` lives on the ultrawide `DP-2` monitor and is split into left/right wings plus a central focus zone
- Workspace `11` on `HDMI-A-1` is a fullscreen cinematic or media surface
- Workspace `1` remains managed for quick tasks or overflow

Adjust widths, monitor identifiers, and class names to align with your actual setup.
