# Streaming preset

Designed for a creator setup with a capture monitor (`DP-1`) and a secondary display (`HDMI-A-1`) used for chat and alert monitoring.

## Application targets
- OBS Studio with class `obs`
- Browser windows with classes `firefox` or `chromium` for chat dashboards
- Music player with class `spotify`

## Workspace layout assumptions
- Workspace `7` on `DP-1` is dedicated to OBS controls
- Workspace `8` on `HDMI-A-1` keeps chat and alerts docked to the right
- Workspace `9` holds background music or ambience controls

Tailor the workspace IDs, monitor names, and application classes to match your streaming rig.
