# Gaming preset

This layout expects a primary high-refresh monitor advertised as `DP-1` and an optional secondary monitor for chat/overlays.

## Application targets
- Game or launcher windows with classes `steam`, `heroic`, or `lutris`
- Voice chat overlay using class `vesktop`

## Workspace layout assumptions
- Workspace `5` is the main play surface on `DP-1`
- Workspace `6` hosts overlays or voice chat

Consider enabling `redactTitles` if your overlays expose sensitive information. Update the class names if your launcher uses a different identifier.
