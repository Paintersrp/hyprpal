# Coding preset

This preset assumes a dual-monitor workstation with the primary development monitor exposed as `DP-1` and a secondary communications monitor exposed as `HDMI-A-1`.

## Application targets
- IDE window with class `code` (Visual Studio Code) on workspace `1`
- Terminal windows with class `Alacritty` to dock alongside the IDE
- Communication clients with classes `Slack` or `discord` on workspace `3`

## Workspace layout assumptions
- Workspace `1` is your main development surface on `DP-1`
- Workspace `2` is left unmanaged for ad-hoc windows
- Workspace `3` lives on `HDMI-A-1` for persistent comms

Adjust monitor names, classes, or workspace IDs to match your Hyprland environment.
